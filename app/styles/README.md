## Styles folder
### Contains:
##### - [main.scss](../app/styles/main.scss)

- Used for importing the `app/base/` Sass files.
- Used for importing the Bootstrap grid from `bower_components`.
- Used for importing the component styles from `app/components/`.
- Used for importing fonts (if necessary; rather store fonts in `app/fonts` for improvement of page loading time).
- Used for main styling (as little as possible since everything should be styled via components).
