## Dist folder
### Contains:

The built Nova framework generated by the Gruntfile.  
Do **not** edit files in here. Edit files in the `../app/` folder instead.  
Then `$ grunt build` in the terminal to update this section. 

When using the Nova framework externally: only use files from this folder. Since *these* files are optimized, minimalized etc.

*To do: Automatically generate a Github hosted page of the style guide (Mind the relative links)*
